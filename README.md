* A CLI app to project incomes/amounts from one country to another (WIP)

* This app will help answer questions like these:

> If someone earns USD 100,000 living in the USA, how much would that income be equivalent to in India, taking into account purchasing power parity?

> What is the average income of a person in Germany as expressed in Chinese yuan or Indian rupees, taking into account purchasing power parity in China/India?


It's a work in progress for now.
